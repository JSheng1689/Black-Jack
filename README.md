# Black-Jack

Goal: Make website to play blackjack with others vs computer dealer. 

Languages: HTML, CSS, JS

Lessons: Learned more about frontend design, backend functionality. Focused on cleaning up backend code as it became more convoluted as we progressed. Tried to keep functions short and clear.

Potential future features: Animations, more black jack card options (splits, double down), multiplayer, further frontend design
